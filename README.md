Taseo is short for "Teacher and student develop each other".

If you know the famous website "Rate My Professors", you can view this project as "Rate My Students".

Professors leave remarks for students and view history remarks given by other professors. It is intended to provide evaluation criteria other than academic records to help knowing students better.

The deployment is actually done on the dev branch, not the main branch, since I was in China back then where it's excruciatingly painful to make adjustments to my deployment.
